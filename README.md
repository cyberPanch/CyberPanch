Motivated and detail-oriented professional with a background in traffic control and a strong interest in cybersecurity. Adept at managing teams, implementing safety protocols, and analyzing technical systems to ensure efficiency and security. Over a year of dedicated training through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and Steven‚Äôs MyDFIR 30-Day Challenge, building hands-on skills in threat detection, digital forensics, and incident response. Proven ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies, demonstrated through setting up and managing a cloud-based cybersecurity lab. Looking to transition into a cybersecurity role where I can apply my skills in log management, threat hunting, and network security.


## Objective
As I continue to sharpen my skills in areas like threat detection, digital forensics, and incident response, I‚Äôm actively pursuing opportunities to break into the cybersecurity field. My goal is to join a team where I can grow, contribute, and help protect critical systems while continuing to develop as a security practitioner.
